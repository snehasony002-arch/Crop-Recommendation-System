# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System

A Machine Learning web application that recommends the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. The application is built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask, providing a simple web interface for real-time crop prediction.

---

## Overview

Selecting the right crop is essential for improving agricultural productivity. This project uses a trained **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the most appropriate crop from soil and climate parameters.

Users enter agricultural parameters through a Flask web application, and the model returns the recommended crop along with useful cultivation information.

## Dataset

The model is trained using an agricultural dataset containing the following input features:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall

**Target Variable**

- Crop Label

---

## Model

**Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest was selected because it:

- Handles nonlinear relationships effectively
- Provides strong predictive performance
- Is robust against overfitting
- Performs well on tabular datasets








## Running the Application

Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## Application Workflow

1. Enter soil and environmental parameters.
2. Submit the form.
3. The trained model predicts the most suitable crop.
4. View the recommended crop and its cultivation details.

## Future Enhancements

- Crop image integration
- Prediction confidence score
- Weather API integration
- Fertilizer recommendation engine
- Responsive UI improvements
- Cloud deployment
